Answer: -3/4

Explanation:
1. We rewrite the equations as- y = -2 + (-3/4) * x
                                x = -7/4 + (-3/4) * y

2. Using Person's coefficient formula-

Let p = pearson coefficient
Let x_std = standard deviation of x
Let y_std = standard deviation of y

p = b1 (x_std / y_std)
p = b2 (y_std / x_std)

Multiplying these 2 equations together we get
p^2 = b1 * b2
p^2 = (-3/4) * (-3/4)
p^2 = 9/16
p = 3/4 or -3/4 (depending on correlation of x and y)

3. Finding if 'p' is positive or negative-
We find that both of the original line equations have negative slopes,
so x and y are negatively correlated by definition.

Therefore, p = -3/4.
