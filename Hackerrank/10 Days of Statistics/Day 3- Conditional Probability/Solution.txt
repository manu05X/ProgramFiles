Answer: 1/3

Explanation: 
There are 4 possible cases:- (B, B), (B, G), (G, B), (G, G)

We know that 1 child is a boy, so now we have 3 cases:- (B, B), (B, G), (G, B)

When asked, "what is the probability that both children are boys", the only case that matches this is: (B, B). 
That is, only 1 of the 3 scenarios satisfies the critera, so there is a 1/3 chance that both children are boys.

More info: According to the Boy or Girl paradox given in this Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_or_Girl_paradox 
The answer can also be 2/3 but Hackerrank accepts the answer as 1/3.
